 * The item can be present in multiple pluralization categories; this object unifies handling of them. Not all of the options must be present, however, every possible category for that language should be defined. This means, that different languages may have a different amount of properties defined here.

 * >
 * > — None of your friends are online.

 * >
 * > — You have 0 friends online.
