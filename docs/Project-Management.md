# Project Management

The work on Optolith is managed across different places on GitHub. This way, it can be viewed in different ways, depending on your needs. The issues – the base blocks of project management – are all in the public `optolith-client` repository, so that everyone can see the work progress – and you will need special access to participate in project management.

- **[Client Issues](https://github.com/elyukai/optolith-client/issues):** The `optolith-client` repository contains all bugs, feature requests and other kinds of improvements.
- **[Publications](https://github.com/users/elyukai/projects/4/views/1):** This board is an overview of the general progress of publications in Optolith. It is never directly used.
- **[Missing Entries by Category](https://github.com/users/elyukai/projects/6/views/1):** This board shows unfinished entries from books, grouped by entity type. All listed issues are sorted in chronological order and need to be worked on from top to bottom. Only a single person must work in an entity type group at the same time to prevent identifier clashes.
- **[Database Schema V2](https://github.com/users/elyukai/projects/3/views/1):** This board contains an overview of all missing work needed to finish the V2 database. You may not see the board items if you do not have access to the database repository.

Most of the time, you’ll be using the **[Missing Entries by Category](https://github.com/users/elyukai/projects/6/views/1)** board. If you want to start contributing, search for a column **where nobody is assigned to any of the listed issues** and assign yourself to the first issue of the column. Issues **must** be worked on **from top to bottom** (in chronological order, that is, sorted by publication date of the associated book) and you can’t work on issues in a column with others at the same time to prevent collisions.

If you realize you don’t have enough time to contribute more, it is of course not a problem. But **please unassign yourself** from all issues and add comments to describe your work so far and which branch(es) you used – so that others can continue where you stopped.
