# Project Management

The work on Optolith is managed across different places on GitHub. This way, it can be viewed in different ways, depending on your needs.

- **[Client Issues](https://github.com/elyukai/optolith-client/issues):** The `optolith-client` repository contains all bugs, feature requests and other kinds of improvements.
- **[Publications](https://github.com/users/elyukai/projects/4/views/1):** This board is an overview of the general progress of publications in Optolith. It is never directly used.
- **[Missing Entries by Category](https://github.com/users/elyukai/projects/6/views/1):** This board shows unfinished entries from books, grouped by entity type. All listed issues are sorted in chronological order and need to be worked on from top to bottom. Only a single person must work in an entity type group at the same time to prevent identifier clashes.
- **[Database Schema V2](https://github.com/users/elyukai/projects/3/views/1):** This board contains an overview of all missing work needed to finish the V2 database. You may not see the board items if you do not have access to the database repository.
